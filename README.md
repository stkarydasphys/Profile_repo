I am a physicist who takes pride in being a lifelong learner, currently diving into the field of Data Science and AI. With a research-focused background, I look forward to explore and contribute to this rapidly flourishing domain of tech.

I chose to learn about the manipulation of Data and creation of AI tools, a sector of tech that already revolutionizes industry and every day life alike. After completing my PhD in Early Universe Cosmology, I joined a bootcamp dedicated to these topics, in order to provide for myself a chance to follow my new passion, while bringing along the problem-solving skills that I have cultivated throughout my career.

Having succesfully completed the intensive Data Science and AI bootcamp at Le Wagon, I am now seeking opportunities to work in this field. In addition to my research background, I have 15 years of experience teaching Math and Physics at various levels, hence communication skills are a well cultivated strength of mine. I look forward to be part of a team of like-minded people in a remote or in-person environment.
